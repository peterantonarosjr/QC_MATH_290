# Math 290 Homework #5
## Peter Antonaros

### Note: I am using the 2020 dataset due to its smaller size and being able to run queries against the table in a timeframe that also allows me to check their ouput.  For whatever reason I imported this dataset twice and there were ~806k rows with null vendorid.  At first I thought it was a glitch in the import process, but after the second time I decided to drop these rows.

### Exercise 2

#### Part 1

To calculate the number of trips by vendorid and by the hour(drop off date)...

My first idea was to select the vendorid and dropoff_datetime columns and count them with the condition that I would be grouping them by the hour of dropoff_datetime. I ran into some syntax errors relating to extracting the date. I kept forgetting to include the ' = 2020' part.

This is the final statement here that I used, to show the vendorids, hour of the day (24hrs) and the total trips that occured within those timeframes.

    select vendorid,
    extract('hour' from tpep_dropoff_datetime) as hours,
    count(*) as tripCount
    from yellowtaxi_dataset yd
    where extract ('year' from date(tpep_dropoff_datetime)) = 2020
    group by vendorid, hours;

Now for the second part of this exercise, I needed to first restructure this query. As you can see in the image above, the column referencing the hours was indistiguisable from one day to the next.

    select vendorid, date_trunc('hour', tpep_dropoff_datetime) as hours,
    count(*) as tripCount
    from yellowtaxi_dataset yd
    where extract ('year' from date(tpep_dropoff_datetime)) = 2020
    group by vendorid, hours;

Now we can see with this query using the date_trunc function we are grouping by the hours but retaining the timestamp format when returning.

#### Part 2

My first idea was to treat the above sql query as a subquery, using it in the following way,

    select avg(tripCount) from(
        select date_trunc('hour', tpep_dropoff_datetime) as hours, vendorid,
        count(*) as tripCount
        from yellowtaxi_dataset yd
        where extract ('year' from date(tpep_dropoff_datetime)) = 2020
        group by vendorid, hours
        ) as tripCountAVG;

This worked in finding the average number of trips, but not for the specific timestamp intervals. This returned the average of all trips.

My second attempt at this was to use the power of a CTE (Common table expression). By storing our previous query as a tempoprary table, we can then find the average of a specific column.

    with tripsPerDate as (

        select vendorid, date_trunc('hours', tpep_dropoff_datetime) as hours,
        count(*) as tripCount
        from yellowtaxi_dataset yd
        where extract ('year' from date(tpep_dropoff_datetime)) = 2020
        group by vendorid, hours
    )
    select vendorid,  date_trunc('days', hours) as days,
    avg(tripCount) as dailyAVGTrips,
    min(tripCount) as dailyMinTrips,
    max(TripCount) as dailyMaxTrips
    from tripsPerDate
    where extract ('year' from date(hours)) = 2020
    group by vendorid, days;

The hard part now was retrieving the median since there doesnt exist an explicit 'median' function in Postgres. Instead we use percentile(.5) which mathematically is the same as the median. Final query is below.

    with tripsPerDate as (

        select vendorid, date_trunc('hours', tpep_dropoff_datetime) as hours,
        count(*) as tripCount
        from yellowtaxi_dataset yd
        where extract ('year' from date(tpep_dropoff_datetime)) = 2020
        group by vendorid, hours
    )
    select vendorid,  date_trunc('days', hours) as days,
    avg(tripCount) as dailyAVGTrips,
    min(tripCount) as dailyMinTrips,
    max(TripCount) as dailyMaxTrips,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) within group(order by tripCount) as medianDailyTrips
    from tripsPerDate
    group by vendorid, days
    order by days;

#### Part 3

Now in order to find the avg, min, max of the trip distances I structured my query similar to the one above, except I select for tripdistance rather than trip count.

    with tripsPerDate as (

        select vendorid, date_trunc('hours', tpep_dropoff_datetime) as hours,
        trip_distance as tripDist
        from yellowtaxi_dataset yd
        where extract ('hour' from tpep_dropoff_datetime) >=5 and
        extract ('hour' from tpep_dropoff_datetime) <6
        group by vendorid, hours, trip_distance
    )
    select vendorid,  date_trunc('days', hours) as days,
    avg(tripDist) as dailyAvgTripDist,
    min(tripDist) as dailyMinTripDist,
    max(tripDist) as dailyMaxTripDist,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) within group(order by tripDist) as medDailyTripDist
    from tripsPerDate
    group by vendorid, days
    order by days;

As for what day in 2020 has the least/most amount of unique trips, I did the following

    with tripsPerDate as (

        select vendorid, date_trunc('hours', tpep_dropoff_datetime) as hours,
        count(*) as tripCount
        from yellowtaxi_dataset yd
        where extract ('year' from date(tpep_dropoff_datetime)) = 2020
        group by vendorid, hours
    )
    select vendorid,  date_trunc('days', hours) as days,
    tripCount as minTrips,
    tripCount as maxTrips
    from tripsPerDate
    inner join(
        select max(tripCount) as maxT,
        min(tripcount) as minT
        from tripsPerDate
    ) as minOrMax
    on tripsPerDate.tripCount = minormax.maxT
    or
    tripsPerDate.tripCount = minormax.minT;

![](https://github.com/peterantonarosjr/QC_MATH_290/blob/main/hw05/hw_images/ex2_pt4_attempt1.png)

This does work, but the result seems a little bit confusing at least to me. I can't seem to find something better though.


### Exercise 3

To calculate the average tip percentage (tip_amount/total_amount) for unique trips in 2020 I first tried the following query.

    with tripsPerDate as (

        select distinct *
        from yellowtaxi_dataset yd
    )
    select concat( cast( (sum(tip_amount) / sum(total_amount) * 100)
    as varchar(5) ), '%' )
    as avgTipPercentage
    from tripsPerDate

This works fine as it selects all the distinct trips and divides/multiples the required amounts.
I used some concatenation to add the percentage sign. Also varchar(5) rounds to 2 decimal digits.

To find the average tip percentage by drop off hour of unique trips in 2020, I did the following

    with tripsPerDate as (
        select extract ('hour' from tpep_dropoff_datetime) as hours,
        sum(fare_amount + tip_amount) as totalAmount,
        sum(tip_amount) as tipAmount
        from yellowtaxi_dataset yd
        where extract ('year' from date(tpep_dropoff_datetime)) = 2020
        group by extract ('hour' from tpep_dropoff_datetime)
    )
    select hours, tipAmount/totalAmount as percentTip
    from tripsPerDate
    order by hours;
