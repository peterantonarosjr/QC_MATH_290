# Math 290 Homework #8
## Peter Antonaros

### Exercise 1

First it was clear we would need a sum() of the runtimeminutes,
since the question is asking us the total minutes of all movies Nicolas Cage appeared in. My next line of thinking was that there would be some condition such primaryname = 'Nicolas Cage' and another where the category = 'actor'. These two conditions being met ensure we are viewing movies where Nicolas Cage appeared and he was an actor. After that it was a matter of properly joining the different tables that contained the columns we needed.

```
select sum(runtimeminutes) as cage_runtime_minutes
	from xf_title_principals xtp
full outer join xf_name_basics xnb
	on xtp.nconst = xnb.nconst
full outer join xf_title_basic xtb
	on xtp.tconst = xtb.tconst
where xnb.primaryname = 'Nicolas Cage'
	and xtb."titletype" = 'movie'
	and category = 'actor'

```

### Exercise 2

From the question it was clear we needed both a name of the actor column and some sort of total for the number of movies they were marked under. There was also the need for a year condition whicch in this case was startyear = 2012. Joining the tables with the columns we needed on nconst and tconst was critical since these are the "links" for the join statements.

```
select "primaryname", count(*) numOfMovies
	from  xf_title_principals xtp
full outer join xf_name_basics xnb
	on xtp."nconst" = xnb."nconst"
full outer join xf_title_basic xtb
	on xtp."tconst" = xtb."tconst"
where category = 'actor' and startyear = 2012
	group by primaryname
	order by numOfMovies desc

```

### Exercise 3

This question is essentially a combination of questions 1 and 2. I decided to "slam" together the two sql statements into a singular one by first selecting what we want, ensuring the proper conditions and lastly ordering so that we would see the highest ratings first.

```
select xnb."primaryname", xtb."primarytitle", xtr."averagerating"
	from  xf_title_principals xtp
full outer join xf_name_basics xnb
	on xtp."nconst" = xnb."nconst"
full outer join xf_title_basic xtb
	on xtp."tconst" = xtb."tconst"
full outer join xf_title_ratings xtr
	on xtp."tconst" = xtr."tconst"
where xnb."primaryname" = 'Nicolas Cage'
	and xtr."averagerating" is not null
	and xtp."category" = 'actor'
order by xtr."averagerating" desc

```

### Exercise 4

This question was again a variation of the previous questions. Rather than reiterate the process, the thing we want to focus on here is genres = '{Short}', which is selecting one of multiple possbile genres.

```
select xtb."primarytitle", xtr."averagerating"
	from xf_title_basic xtb
full outer join xf_title_ratings xtr
	on xtb."tconst" = xtr."tconst"
where xtb."genres" = '{Short}'
	and xtr."averagerating" is not null
	and xtb."startyear" = 2009
order by xtr."averagerating" desc

```

### Exercise 5

For question 5 I took note of the conditions since there were many that needed to be met for the query to return the correct values. The start year values needed to be inclusively within the range of 2000 and 2010, the runtime of the given movie needed to be inclusively within 45 and 60 minutes, and the primary name could not be null. This last condition is needed since we want to know the 10 actors names and not just some movie which satisfied the other conditions with no actor name.

```
select xnb."primaryname", count(*) numOfMovies
	from  xf_title_principals xtp
full outer join xf_name_basics xnb
	on xtp."nconst" = xnb."nconst"
full outer join xf_title_basic xtb
	on xtp."tconst" = xtb."tconst"
where xtp."category" = 'actor'
	and xtb."startyear" >= 2000 and xtb."startyear" <= 2010
	and xtb."runtimeminutes" >= 45 and xtb."runtimeminutes" <= 60
	and xnb."primaryname" is not null
group by xnb."primaryname"
order by numOfMovies desc
limit 10

```

### Exercise 6

I used a CTE here since the question seemed to me to be clearly two parts. First find all movies with three word titles by splitting the titles into an array separated by commas. After this we can check for movies of length 3 and where the votes are not null since we are looking for the highest average rating movies. Limit 10 is included for similar reason as in the previous question; we don't care about the entire result, only the top 10.

```
with three_word_titles as(
	select "tconst", regexp_split_to_array("primarytitle", ' ') three_words
	from xf_title_basic xtb
)
select "three_words" as title_name, xtr."numvotes"
	from xf_title_ratings xtr
full outer join three_word_titles
	on three_word_titles."tconst" = xtr."tconst"
where array_length("three_words", 1) = 3
	and xtr."numvotes" is not null
	order by xtr."numvotes" desc
limit 10

```

### Exercise 7 (Extra Credit)

I solved this extra credit question by using similar code to the question above. Here the main idea is that we find the average rating of 2 word title movies and the average rating of 3 word titles movies and compare them. Again a CTE was used since I was approaching the question in two parts rather than as a single entity.

```
with two_versus_three_title as (
	select array_length(regexp_split_to_array("primarytitle", ' '), 1) as title_length,
		xtr."averagerating", "numvotes", "primarytitle", xtb."titletype"
	from xf_title_ratings xtr
	full outer join xf_title_basic xtb
		on xtb."tconst" = xtr."tconst"
)
select "title_length", sum("numvotes") total_votes, avg("averagerating") avgRating
	from two_versus_three_title
where "title_length" > 1 and "title_length" < 4
	and "titletype" = 'movie'
group by "title_length"

```
