### Exercise 1

To plot the data with Power Bi, I first had to choose 'get more visuals' so that I could use the histogram charts. At this point, I could no longer get access to Power Bi as it kept saying my email (cuny email) was not registered.

The process would have been to choose the value field 'averagerating' from title_ratings table and plot it. Then you can make it look nice and customize it how you want. I just used Python instead and connected to local host.

To connect to localhost on my machine, I first needed to edit the pg_ident.conf file and link my linux user to my postgres user. Then I went and edited pg_hba.conf and set the authentication method for this linked user to 'trust'. After that my jupyter notebook was able to establish a connection the the local imdb database.

In the .ipynb file you will find the frequency plot and shapiro wilk test. From the tests we cannot say whether or not the data is normally distributed. Having worked with ratings before, in expectation we say that this would be something that is normally distributed.
