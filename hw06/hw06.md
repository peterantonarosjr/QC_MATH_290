Downloaded & unzipped the files

#### Step 2

Created the imdb database through terminal with...

    create database imdb;

#### Step 3

To create the target tables within the following imdb database, I used the following...

    create table imdb.public.name_basics(
    nconst text,
    primaryName text,
    birthYear text,
    deathYear text,
    primaryProfession text,
    knownForTitles text
    );

    create table  imdb.public.title_akas(
    titleId text,
    ordering_ text,
    title text,
    region text,
    language_ text,
    types_ text,
    attributes_ text,
    isOriginalTitle text
    );

    create table  imdb.public.title_basics(
    tconst text,
    titleType text,
    primaryTitle text,
    originalTitle text,
    isAdult text,
    startYear text,
    endYear text,
    runtimeMinutes text,
    genres text
    );

    create table  imdb.public.title_crew(
    tconst text,
    directors text,
    writers text
    );

    create table  imdb.public.title_episode(
    tconst text,
    parentTconst text,
    seasonNumber text,
    episodeNumber text
    );

    create table  imdb.public.title_principals(
    tconst text,
    ordering_ text,
    nconst text,
    category text,
    job text,
    characters_ text
    );

    create table  imdb.public.title_ratings(
    tconst text,
    averageRating text,
    numVotes text
    );

I used text instead of varchar(n) since I really didn't know how many characters would be in each line. I suppose I could have used an arbitrarily large n, but then that would also lead to wasted space. Using text field allows Postgres to deal with any resizing on its own.

#### Step 4

Copy data from TSVs to their respective target tables through terminal connected to postgres DB.

    COPY name_basics FROM '/tmp/name.basics.tsv' DELIMITER E'\t';
    COPY title_akas FROM '/tmp/title.akas.tsv' DELIMITER E'\t';
    COPY title_basics FROM '/tmp/title.basics.tsv' DELIMITER E'\t';
    COPY title_crew FROM '/tmp/title.crew.tsv' DELIMITER E'\t';
    COPY title_episode FROM '/tmp/title.episode.tsv' DELIMITER E'\t';
    COPY title_principals FROM '/tmp/title.principals.tsv' DELIMITER E'\t';
    COPY title_ratings FROM '/tmp/title.ratings.tsv' DELIMITER E'\t';

Running a check on my tables to see if the data was populated,

    select * from name_basics nb;
    select * from title_akas ta;
    select * from title_basics tb;
    select * from title_crew tc;
    select * from title_episode te;
    select * from title_principals tp;
    select * from title_ratings tr;

#### Step 5

I simply delete where the first column is equal to the first column's name which removes the offending first row.

    delete from name_basics where nconst = 'nconst';
    delete from title_akas where titleid = 'titleId';
    delete from title_basics where tconst = 'tconst';
    delete from title_crew where tconst = 'tconst';
    delete from title_episode where tconst = 'tconst';
    delete from title_principals where tconst = 'tconst';
    delete from title_ratings where tconst = 'tconst';

Each successful operation noted only 1 row was updated, so I also am sure no other data was changed (JUST IN CASE)

#### Step 6

Copy and store the tables as CSV files through terminal.

    COPY name_basics(nconst,
        primaryName,
        birthYear,
        deathYear,
        primaryProfession,
        knownForTitles)to '/tmp/name_basics.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

    COPY title_akas(titleId,
        ordering_,
        title,
        region,
        language_,
        types_,
        attributes_,
        isOriginalTitle) to '/tmp/title_akas.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

    COPY title_basics(tconst,
        titleType,
        primaryTitle,
        originalTitle,
        isAdult,
        startYear,
        endYear,
        runtimeMinutes,
        genres) to '/tmp/title_basics.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

    COPY title_crew(tconst,
        directors,
        writers) to '/tmp/title_crew.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

    COPY title_episode(tconst,
    parentTconst,
    seasonNumber,
    episodeNumber) to '/tmp/title_episode.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

    COPY title_principals(tconst,
        ordering_,
        nconst,
        category,
        job,
        characters_) to '/tmp/title_principals.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

    COPY title_ratings(tconst,
        averageRating,
        numVotes) to '/tmp/title_ratings.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

### Exercise 3

#### Step 1
Now for checking the cardinality of columns in order to assign a primary key to each table...

    select count(*) from name_basics nb; /*11,498,571*/
    select count(distinct nconst) from name_basics nb; /*11,498,571*/

    select count(*) from title_akas ta; /*31,436,720*/
    select count(distinct titleid) from title_akas nb; /*6,214,679*/

    select count(*) from title_basics tb; /*8,784,772*/
    select count(distinct tconst) from title_basics tb; /*8,784,772*/

    select count(*) from title_crew tc; /*8,784,772*/
    select count(distinct tconst) from title_crew tc; /*8,784,772*/

    select count(*) from title_episode te; /*6,581,647*/
    select count(distinct tconst) from title_episode te; /*6,581,647*/

    select count(*) from title_principals tp; /*49,478,209*/
    select count(distinct tconst) from title_principals tp; /*7,913,307*/

    select count(*) from title_ratings tr; /*1,226,998*/
    select count(distinct tconst) from title_ratings tr; /*1,226,998*/

#### Step 2
From this we can determine that tables title_akas, and title_principals will not have a unique primary key with one column. They will need to be tested for composite keys.

For the title_akas table...

    select count(distinct (titleid,ordering_)) from title_akas nb; /*31,436,720*/


For the title_principals table...

    select count(distinct (tconst, ordering_)) from title_principals tp; /*49,478,209*/

We can now create a composite primary key using the two columns specified in the statements above.  This is because the number of unique elements between the two columns is equal to the length of the respective table.

#### Step 3

Creating and adding primary keys for the respective tables as follows...

    alter table name_basics add primary key (nconst);
    alter table title_akas add primary key (titleId, ordering_);
    alter table title_basics add primary key (tconst);
    alter table title_crew add primary key (tconst);
    alter table title_episode add primary key (tconst);
    alter table title_principals add primary key (tconst, ordering_);
    alter table title_ratings add primary key (tconst);


### Exercise 4

#### Step 1

Using the except statement, which combines two select statements and returns rows from the first query that are not in the second query. The following code accomplishes this and counts the disjoint count...

    select count(*) from(
        select tconst from title_ratings tr
        except
        select tconst from title_basics tb
    ) as tconstCounter; /*Returns 4 -> present in title_r not in title_b*/

    select count(*) from(
        select tconst from title_basics tb
        except
        select tconst from title_ratings tr
    ) as tconstCounter; /*Returns 7,557,778 -> present in title_b not in title_r*/

#### Step 2

The following code does something similar, but rather than returning the count, it returns the disjoint set itself...

    select * from(
        select tconst from title_ratings tr
        except
        select tconst from title_basics tb
    ) as tconstVals;

#### Step 3

Similar structure was used to count the intersection between the two sets...

    select * from(
        select tconst from title_ratings tr
        except
        select tconst from title_basics tb
    ) as tconstVals; /*Returns 1,226,994*/

#### Step 4

Based on these results, I believe that the parent table should be neither. I say this because as we can see, both tables contain tconst values not present in the other. This would violate the foreign constraints. I will test both with the following code...


#### Step 5

    alter table title_ratings add constraint
        fk_title_basics_tconst foreign key (tconst)
        references title_basics (tconst); /*title_basics parent*/

    alter table title_basics add constraint
        fk_title_ratings_tconst foreign key (tconst)
        references title_ratings (tconst); /*title_ratings parent*/


#### Step 6

They both result in an error that says some *key* is not present in the parent table, which makes sense, since their was not a complete intersection between the two sets. Neither is a proper subset of the other.
